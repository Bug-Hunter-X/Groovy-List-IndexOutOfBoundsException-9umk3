This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Groovy when dealing with list indices.  Attempting to access an element outside the valid range of a list does not throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException, but rather silently returns null.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues in larger applications. The solution provides a robust way to handle such scenarios.
